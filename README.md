# AEGEE-London website

Repository for the AEGEE-London [website](http://aegee-london.eu).

The website is vanilla ES5 JavaScript, HTML and CSS bundled with Gulp and served statically from [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), hosting service with no costs. We don't make use of any CMS. No WordPress, Wix or similar. If you're the IT responsible for your antenna, you like our webpage and you'd like to use it, feel free to fork the repo, make the necessary changes and republish the website for your own antenna. It would be the best honour for [Tony](https://github.com/AntonioRedondo), the responsible for our site. When reusing our code please remember to leave the footer with the link to the original repo and the link to Tony's GitHub. We pay ~10â‚¬ a year for the `aegee-london.eu` domain on [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com).
